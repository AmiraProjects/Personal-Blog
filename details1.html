                <h3>My Thoughts -> "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham</h3>
                <p>Hi friends, I'm finally back since I'm off a few months ago! In the past weeks, I've been reading a book about stock market 
                    A little bit krn isinya 'membagongkan'. I dont know membagongkan in english, wkwkwk. 
                    To be specific, the history of stock market since the establishment of Wall Street. Turns out it's pretty complicatedüòÖ. 
                    So, this is basically my understanding about this chapter!
                     
                    Also, I'm sorry if you all didn't understand since this book explained the history not in order and it's hard for me to make it in order 
                    (maybe because it's also my first-time reading about investment) üôè.
                    Dan ini juga sebenernya challenge from my dad & mom utk ngisi liburan term 1. 
                    <br>
                    In 1970, a huge deterioration happened in the earnings of many corporations, the invested capital's rate of profit fell to the lowest percentage since the world war year. 
                    A lot of companies had become "financially troubled" as they had a number of net losses for the first time in 3 decades. 
                    A lot of people with long experience and innate caution couldn't stop thinking about the 1926 - 1929 bull market and the tragic aftermath. 
                    Although the closing price in 1970 of the DJIA was same as 6.5 years before, 
                    nothing that happened to stock markets or business that can be compared with the depression bear market in 1929 - 1932.
                    <br><br>
                    In 1953, the average market level has gained 50% in five years to 275. 
                    However, they were concerned as in 1953, the average had increased for longer time than most bull markets. 
                    They also advised a caution or compromise policy. 
                    After a long analysis, they concluded that the present stock prices level was too high, making it a dangerous one. 
                    The recovery of common-stock prices created a corresponding revision of Wall Street. 
                    In June 1964, many predictions had appeared to be more bearish, and they were mixed (between bearish and bullish) after the partial recovery by the end of that year. 
                    But at the beginning of 1964, nearly all forecasts were on the bullish side, and they continue advancing. 
                    <br><br>
                    Although this book explained that 1964 market level is dangerous, Investors should not conclude the danger of 1964 market level only because they read this book. 
                    They need to know the reasons and hear from the most competent & experienced people on Wall Street. 
                    At last, investors must decide and accept all their responsibility and consequences. 
                    However, this book advised that if an investor isn't so sure on which course to follow, they must be cautious and follow the principles of investment. 
                    <br><br>
                    So, the summary are : Bull markets happens when many optimistic people buy stocks of companies that has good performances 
                    (high chances of profit, consistent). Bear markets happen when people started to sell the stocks which they had buy. 
                    Then, there was a tipping point where a bull market started to become bear market and vice versa. 
                    However, people who did not understand about stock market well can sometimes be too optimistic. 
                    They keep buying the stocks without realizing what would happen next. 
                    Although not all people were like that, some people who is expert enough could realize the potential of a bear market, they started to sell their stocks. 
                    And when the bear market comes, people who aren‚Äôt good enough suffered a huge loss (they‚Äôre too late to sell their stocks) unlike the expert people. 
                    The cycle of the stock market always continues to spin, from bull to bear to bull again. For how long? Depends on the people who did the transaction.
