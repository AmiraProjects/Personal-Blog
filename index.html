                                This project will be the simplest one. 
                                I made this just to relax and trying to memorize things I had learn from my coding course. 
                                It's about catching healthy foods that was falling and let the unhealthy ones fall. 
                                Thats why the title is Food Fall. 
                                Oh ya, one more, if we catch a water bottle, it will add the health points. 
                                It was pretty easy to make since it just took 3 days for me to finish and only consist of few codes & layouts. 
                                I just have to find or draw many foods or drinks to be the sprites.

                                This game can be played both on computer and phone but it's easier to play on phone rather than on a computer. <br>

                        <h3>Projects -- The Glorious of Math</h3>
                        <p>Hi guys!
                        Finally! I can make a project with my friends, but this is just a prototype. 
                        We collaborate for about 2 weeks. 
                        For me, the coding step took quiet a long time to finish because I have to manage my time with school tasks and prepare for school exams. 
                        Since I'm not really good at drawing, I told my friend Gadiza to draw the characters. 
                        Nara create the questions by herself and Aisha search for the background on google with no copyright.
                        Oh ya, this game can only be played on a computer or PC.
                        If you're interested to see it, here's the link: <br>

                        <h3>Projects -- Space Exploration</h3>
                        <p>The first game I made with construct. 
                            I created this as my first coding course task. 
                            It's filled with basic codes and the animations was still stiff. 
                            Also, mostly the sprites are from google and I only draw some details like boxes, 
                            trophies and the sky on Inkscape or the construct itself. 
                            This game is about an adventurer that crashed land on a dangerous planet, and she had to go back to her ship and met her friend. 
                            After she get into the ship, she will explore 3 other planets. 
                            It's actually optional for you to play. The goal is to open the box and get the trophy for those 3 planets. 
                            It was pretty hard to make. It took about 2-3 week to finish even though I continue making this during free time. 

                            It can only be played on a laptop or computer. <br>

                        <h3>Project -- Feeding Fish</h3>
                        <p>The "Feeding Fish" game is about a fish that was searching for its food in the ocean.
                            But, there are lots of plastics inside the oceans, so it has to avoid them while searching for food. 
                            There was also jelly fish & octopus to avoid. 
                            This game was made in just 1 week since its very simple game & easy to make. 
                            To play this game, you will have to select the fish's skin first. 
                            There were 10 skin you can choose. Then, you can play the game by pressing the arrow button to move. 
                            This game type is endless, which means there is no end as long as the fish had a life. 
                            When the game was over, you can choose between replay (play the game again, same skin, saves your high score) 
                            or restart (play the game again, choose new skin, but didn't save your high score). 
                            Each small fish had different amount of score when you eat them. 
                            The orange fish gives you 1 life & scores although they were fast and hard to catch.  <br>

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia, Is It True?</h3>
                        <p> After I read some news about The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia, 
                            I was sad that many Indonesian companies had to hire programmers from other countries like India, Vietnam or Australia. 
                            This is the reason why I wanted to be a programmer other than because I like it. 
                            Even Gojek had to hire people from India to work for them and had built an office on Bengaluru, India. 
                            So that’s why Indonesia needed programmers and engineers to increase the growth of economy. 
                            The quality of education on IT ranks 8 in Southeast Asia. 
                            I think the government needs to develop the logic of Indonesian people more and since young age. 
                            For example, coding should be taught earlier, and kids need to have chance to code, either making simple, 
                            useful website or application like in Singapore. 
                            We also should develop education in Indonesia especially regarding the importance of technology for the future and 
                            improving the education quality on IT. 
                            Those are some of my opinions about The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia.</p>

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> Ujian Terberat</h3>
                        <p> Holaa, jangan bosen ya kalo aku post-post lagi. Mumpung masih ada 2 hari lagi nih liburnya.
                            <br>
                            Finally! Semua ujian udah aku laluin! Except Mock ya karena baru dikerjakan bulan Mei. 
                            Ujian kali ini berat banget : 3 minggu berturut-turut dari TO kecamatan, final exam, ujian sekolah. 
                            Belum lagi aku ikut Cambridge Checkpoint yang berarti aku harus masuk sekolah 2 hari sebelum libur 
                            (Ada juga sih beberapa temenku yang ikut checkpoint juga). 
                            Dan aku ngerjain semua ujian itu pas puasa. Untung aja kita go home nya lebih cepet - yang biasanya jam setengah 3, 
                            jadi jam 11 udah pulang. Jadi aku bisa langsung istirahat pas sampe rumah. 
                            After semua ujian itu selesai, ada 2-week holiday yang menunggu. 
                            Pokoknya aku happy banget setelah hari terakhir Cambridge checkpoint selesai. 
                            Aku bisa bebas ngapain aja pas libur! Aku bisa jalan-jalan ke mall, main game, nonton, dan posting blog ini juga! 
                            Aku juga main sih sama sepupuku. Tapi yang 1 masih bocil & yang 1 lagi baru kelas 4. 
                            Mungkin karena kelamaan libur, aku jadi bosen juga, bingung mau ngapain lagi 😅. 
                            Anddd, ternyata 1.5 bulan lagi aku graduation & 18 Juli aku udah SMP, yeayy. Gak kerasa ya, cepet banget.</p>

                        <p>Finallyyyy! seragam sekolahku akhirnya udah bisa diambilll. 
                            Baju polo, kain batik sama kain buat bawahan udah ada. Tinggal jahit kain batik sama celana nya. 
                            Rencanyanya seragam batikku mau kayak gini : 
                            <br>
                            Tapi aku masih milih-milih model yang cocok sama aku. 
                            Yang jelas, aku pakai model kerah Shanghai sama celana panjang. 
                            Kerah Shanghai yang aku pakai nanti seperti ini: 
                            <br>
                            Kerah Shanghai adalah model pakaian yang memiliki bagian kerah pendek dan pas di leher dengan bagian depan yang membentuk huruf V. 
                            Dinamakan seperti itu karena model kerah ini diadaptasi dari pakaian tradisional wanita Tionghoa yang disebut dengan cheongsam.  
                            Aku pakai kerah Shanghai karena, menurutku lebih nyaman. 
                            Aku juga tidak perlu mengaitkan kancing yang paling atas. 
                            Dan yang paling penting adalah kerah Shanghai memenuhi aturan dress code sekolah.

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham</h3>
                        <p>Hi friends, I'm finally back since I'm off a few months ago! In the past weeks, I've been reading a book about stock market 
                            A little bit krn isinya 'membagongkan'. I dont know membagongkan in english, wkwkwk. 
                            To be specific, the history of stock market since the establishment of Wall Street. Turns out it's pretty complicated😅. 
                            So, this is basically my understanding about this chapter! 
                            Also, I'm sorry if you all didn't understand since this book explained the history not in order and it's hard for me to make it in order 
                            (maybe because it's also my first-time reading about investment) 🙏.
                            Dan ini juga sebenernya challenge from my dad & mom utk ngisi liburan term 1. 
                            <br>
                            In 1970, a huge deterioration happened in the earnings of many corporations, the invested capital's rate of profit fell to the lowest percentage since the world war year. 
                            A lot of companies had become "financially troubled" as they had a number of net losses for the first time in 3 decades. 
                            A lot of people with long experience and innate caution couldn't stop thinking about the 1926 - 1929 bull market and the tragic aftermath. 
                            Although the closing price in 1970 of the DJIA was same as 6.5 years before, 
                            nothing that happened to stock markets or business that can be compared with the depression bear market in 1929 - 1932.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1953, the average market level has gained 50% in five years to 275. 
                            However, they were concerned as in 1953, the average had increased for longer time than most bull markets. 
                            They also advised a caution or compromise policy. 
                            After a long analysis, they concluded that the present stock prices level was too high, making it a dangerous one. 
                            The recovery of common-stock prices created a corresponding revision of Wall Street. 
                            In June 1964, many predictions had appeared to be more bearish, and they were mixed (between bearish and bullish) after the partial recovery by the end of that year. 
                            But at the beginning of 1964, nearly all forecasts were on the bullish side, and they continue advancing. 
                            <br><br>
                            Although this book explained that 1964 market level is dangerous, Investors should not conclude the danger of 1964 market level only because they read this book. 
                            They need to know the reasons and hear from the most competent & experienced people on Wall Street. 
                            At last, investors must decide and accept all their responsibility and consequences. 
                            However, this book advised that if an investor isn't so sure on which course to follow, they must be cautious and follow the principles of investment. 
                            <br><br>
                            So, the summary are : Bull markets happens when many optimistic people buy stocks of companies that has good performances 
                            (high chances of profit, consistent). Bear markets happen when people started to sell the stocks which they had buy. 
                            Then, there was a tipping point where a bull market started to become bear market and vice versa. 
                            However, people who did not understand about stock market well can sometimes be too optimistic. 
                            They keep buying the stocks without realizing what would happen next. 
                            Although not all people were like that, some people who is expert enough could realize the potential of a bear market, they started to sell their stocks. 
                            And when the bear market comes, people who aren’t good enough suffered a huge loss (they’re too late to sell their stocks) unlike the expert people. 
                            The cycle of the stock market always continues to spin, from bull to bear to bull again. For how long? Depends on the people who did the transaction.
