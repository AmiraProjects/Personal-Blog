                                This project will be the simplest one. 
                                I made this just to relax and trying to memorize things I had learn from my coding course. 
                                It's about catching healthy foods that was falling and let the unhealthy ones fall. 
                                Thats why the title is Food Fall. 
                                Oh ya, one more, if we catch a water bottle, it will add the health points. 
                                It was pretty easy to make since it just took 3 days for me to finish and only consist of few codes & layouts. 
                                I just have to find or draw many foods or drinks to be the sprites.

                                This game can be played both on computer and phone but it's easier to play on phone rather than on a computer. <br>

                        <h3>Projects -- The Glorious of Math</h3>
                        <p>Hi guys!
                        Finally! I can make a project with my friends, but this is just a prototype. 
                        We collaborate for about 2 weeks. 
                        For me, the coding step took quiet a long time to finish because I have to manage my time with school tasks and prepare for school exams. 
                        Since I'm not really good at drawing, I told my friend Gadiza to draw the characters. 
                        Nara create the questions by herself and Aisha search for the background on google with no copyright.
                        Oh ya, this game can only be played on a computer or PC.
                        If you're interested to see it, here's the link: <br>

                        <h3>Projects -- Space Exploration</h3>
                        <p>The first game I made with construct. 
                            I created this as my first coding course task. 
                            It's filled with basic codes and the animations was still stiff. 
                            Also, mostly the sprites are from google and I only draw some details like boxes, 
                            trophies and the sky on Inkscape or the construct itself. 
                            This game is about an adventurer that crashed land on a dangerous planet, and she had to go back to her ship and met her friend. 
                            After she get into the ship, she will explore 3 other planets. 
                            It's actually optional for you to play. The goal is to open the box and get the trophy for those 3 planets. 
                            It was pretty hard to make. It took about 2-3 week to finish even though I continue making this during free time. 

                            It can only be played on a laptop or computer. <br>

                        <h3>Project -- Feeding Fish</h3>
                        <p>The "Feeding Fish" game is about a fish that was searching for its food in the ocean.
                            But, there are lots of plastics inside the oceans, so it has to avoid them while searching for food. 
                            There was also jelly fish & octopus to avoid. 
                            This game was made in just 1 week since its very simple game & easy to make. 
                            To play this game, you will have to select the fish's skin first. 
                            There were 10 skin you can choose. Then, you can play the game by pressing the arrow button to move. 
                            This game type is endless, which means there is no end as long as the fish had a life. 
                            When the game was over, you can choose between replay (play the game again, same skin, saves your high score) 
                            or restart (play the game again, choose new skin, but didn't save your high score). 
                            Each small fish had different amount of score when you eat them. 
                            The orange fish gives you 1 life & scores although they were fast and hard to catch.  <br>

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia, Is It True?</h3>
                        <p> After I read some news about The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia, 
                            I was sad that many Indonesian companies had to hire programmers from other countries like India, Vietnam or Australia. 
                            This is the reason why I wanted to be a programmer other than because I like it. 
                            Even Gojek had to hire people from India to work for them and had built an office on Bengaluru, India. 
                            So that’s why Indonesia needed programmers and engineers to increase the growth of economy. 
                            The quality of education on IT ranks 8 in Southeast Asia. 
                            I think the government needs to develop the logic of Indonesian people more and since young age. 
                            For example, coding should be taught earlier, and kids need to have chance to code, either making simple, 
                            useful website or application like in Singapore. 
                            We also should develop education in Indonesia especially regarding the importance of technology for the future and 
                            improving the education quality on IT. 
                            Those are some of my opinions about The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia.</p>

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> Ujian Terberat</h3>
                        <p> Holaa, jangan bosen ya kalo aku post-post lagi. Mumpung masih ada 2 hari lagi nih liburnya.
                            <br>
                            Finally! Semua ujian udah aku laluin! Except Mock ya karena baru dikerjakan bulan Mei. 
                            Ujian kali ini berat banget : 3 minggu berturut-turut dari TO kecamatan, final exam, ujian sekolah. 
                            Belum lagi aku ikut Cambridge Checkpoint yang berarti aku harus masuk sekolah 2 hari sebelum libur 
                            (Ada juga sih beberapa temenku yang ikut checkpoint juga). 
                            Dan aku ngerjain semua ujian itu pas puasa. Untung aja kita go home nya lebih cepet - yang biasanya jam setengah 3, 
                            jadi jam 11 udah pulang. Jadi aku bisa langsung istirahat pas sampe rumah. 
                            After semua ujian itu selesai, ada 2-week holiday yang menunggu. 
                            Pokoknya aku happy banget setelah hari terakhir Cambridge checkpoint selesai. 
                            Aku bisa bebas ngapain aja pas libur! Aku bisa jalan-jalan ke mall, main game, nonton, dan posting blog ini juga! 
                            Aku juga main sih sama sepupuku. Tapi yang 1 masih bocil & yang 1 lagi baru kelas 4. 
                            Mungkin karena kelamaan libur, aku jadi bosen juga, bingung mau ngapain lagi 😅. 
                            Anddd, ternyata 1.5 bulan lagi aku graduation & 18 Juli aku udah SMP, yeayy. Gak kerasa ya, cepet banget.</p>

                        <h3>My Thoughts ->  Baju Seragam</h3>
                        <p>Finallyyyy! seragam sekolahku akhirnya udah bisa diambilll. 
                            Baju polo, kain batik sama kain buat bawahan udah ada. Tinggal jahit kain batik sama celana nya. 
                            Rencanyanya seragam batikku mau kayak gini : 
                            <br>
                            Tapi aku masih milih-milih model yang cocok sama aku. 
                            Yang jelas, aku pakai model kerah Shanghai sama celana panjang. 
                            Kerah Shanghai yang aku pakai nanti seperti ini: 
                            <br>
                            Kerah Shanghai adalah model pakaian yang memiliki bagian kerah pendek dan pas di leher dengan bagian depan yang membentuk huruf V. 
                            Dinamakan seperti itu karena model kerah ini diadaptasi dari pakaian tradisional wanita Tionghoa yang disebut dengan cheongsam.  
                            Aku pakai kerah Shanghai karena, menurutku lebih nyaman. 
                            Aku juga tidak perlu mengaitkan kancing yang paling atas. 
                            Dan yang paling penting adalah kerah Shanghai memenuhi aturan dress code sekolah.

                        <h3>My Thoughts -> "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham</h3>
                        <p>Hi friends, I'm finally back since I'm off a few months ago! In the past weeks, I've been reading a book about stock market 
                            A little bit krn isinya 'membagongkan'. I dont know membagongkan in english, wkwkwk. 
                            To be specific, the history of stock market since the establishment of Wall Street. Turns out it's pretty complicated😅. 
                            So, this is basically my understanding about this chapter! 
                            Also, I'm sorry if you all didn't understand since this book explained the history not in order and it's hard for me to make it in order 
                            (maybe because it's also my first-time reading about investment) 🙏.
                            Dan ini juga sebenernya challenge from my dad & mom utk ngisi liburan term 1. 
                            <br>
                            In 1970, a huge deterioration happened in the earnings of many corporations, the invested capital's rate of profit fell to the lowest percentage since the world war year. 
                            A lot of companies had become "financially troubled" as they had a number of net losses for the first time in 3 decades. 
                            A lot of people with long experience and innate caution couldn't stop thinking about the 1926 - 1929 bull market and the tragic aftermath. 
                            Although the closing price in 1970 of the DJIA was same as 6.5 years before, 
                            nothing that happened to stock markets or business that can be compared with the depression bear market in 1929 - 1932.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1953, the average market level has gained 50% in five years to 275. 
                            However, they were concerned as in 1953, the average had increased for longer time than most bull markets. 
                            They also advised a caution or compromise policy. 
                            After a long analysis, they concluded that the present stock prices level was too high, making it a dangerous one. 
                            The recovery of common-stock prices created a corresponding revision of Wall Street. 
                            In June 1964, many predictions had appeared to be more bearish, and they were mixed (between bearish and bullish) after the partial recovery by the end of that year. 
                            But at the beginning of 1964, nearly all forecasts were on the bullish side, and they continue advancing. 
                            <br><br>
                            Although this book explained that 1964 market level is dangerous, Investors should not conclude the danger of 1964 market level only because they read this book. 
                            They need to know the reasons and hear from the most competent & experienced people on Wall Street. 
                            At last, investors must decide and accept all their responsibility and consequences. 
                            However, this book advised that if an investor isn't so sure on which course to follow, they must be cautious and follow the principles of investment. 
                            <br><br>
                            So, the summary are : Bull markets happens when many optimistic people buy stocks of companies that has good performances 
                            (high chances of profit, consistent). Bear markets happen when people started to sell the stocks which they had buy. 
                            Then, there was a tipping point where a bull market started to become bear market and vice versa. 
                            However, people who did not understand about stock market well can sometimes be too optimistic. 
                            They keep buying the stocks without realizing what would happen next. 
                            Although not all people were like that, some people who is expert enough could realize the potential of a bear market, they started to sell their stocks. 
                            And when the bear market comes, people who aren’t good enough suffered a huge loss (they’re too late to sell their stocks) unlike the expert people. 
                            The cycle of the stock market always continues to spin, from bull to bear to bull again. For how long? Depends on the people who did the transaction.

                        <h3>Short Story (Akankah Sungai Kembali Jernih?)</h3>
                        <p>Akankah Sungai Kembali Jernih?
                            <br>
                            Oleh Amira Nabila Rachman
                            <br>
                            “Aku mau memancing ikan sama Indy di dekat sungai ya, Bu!” ucap Vivi.<br>
                            “Ok, boleh. Tapi, pulangnya jangan terlalu sore,” kata Ibu Vivi. <br>
                            Sudah cukup lama Vivi tidak memancing ikan bersama Indy. 
                            Dulu, ia suka memancing ikan bersama teman sekelas sekaligus tetangganya itu di sungai dekat rumah karena 
                            di sungai itu terdapat banyak sekali ikan. Ikan yang ia dapat kemudian dimasak. <br>
                            “Maaf aku datang agak telat. Soalnya, aku tadi lagi main basket,” kata Indy ketika ia sampai di sungai.<br>
                            “Sudah dapat berapa ikan Vi?” tanya Indy lagi.<br>
                            “Belum dapat sama sekali, nih. Kenapa ya sekarang susah banget dapat ikan? 
                            Padahal dulu aku bisa dapat banyak ikan.” Wajah Vivi mulai terlihat putus asa.<br>
                            Tiba-tiba, Vivi merasa ada yang tersangkut di pancingnya. <br>
                            Ia segera mengangkat pancingnya dan berharap mendapatkan ikan. Ternyata itu adalah sebuah kantong plastik.<br>
                            “Mungkin karena sungai ini sudah tercemar oleh plastik-plastik seperti yang kamu temukan tadi. 
                            Plastik-plastik itu dibuang orang ke sungai ini sehingga ikan-ikan lama- kelamaan akan mati karena airnya tercemar,” jawab Indy.<br>
                            “Bisa jadi. Tapi kenapa orang-orang membuang plastik ke sungai? Padahal ada tempat sampah,” tanya Vivi. <br>
                            Vivi pulang ke rumah dengan wajah muram. Ia kemudian bertanya ke orang tuanya, apakah ikan di sungai berkurang karena airnya tercemar oleh plastik-plastik yang dibuang sembarangan. <br>
                            “Iya Vi. Ikan-ikan akan memakan plastik-plastik itu. Mereka mengira plastik itu adalah makanan.
                            Padahal, plastik itu sulit terurai. Lama-lama plastik akan berubah menjadi mikroplastik yang beracun bagi makhluk hidup,” jelas ibu Vivi.<br>
                            Vivi merasa sedih mendengarnya. Ia tidak mau kelak ia akan makan ikan beracun. 
                            Ia merasa harus melakukan sesuatu.
                            Besoknya Vivi menjelaskan rencananya di depan kelas.<br>
                            “Kita harus membersihkan sungai, teman-teman. Kalau tidak,  hewan dan tumbuhan akan mati. 
                            Sampah juga dapat menyumbat selokan. Saat hujan deras, manusia akan kebanjiran. 
                            Akhirnya kita semua akan rugi.”<br>
                            Hampir semua teman-teman Vivi setuju dengan idenya.
                            Bahkan ada beberapa murid yang tidak sekelas dengan Vivi ketika mendengar dari teman lain ingin ikut membantunya. 
                            Ibu guru juga sangat mendukung ide Vivi.<br>
                            Vivi dan teman-teman sepakat untuk membersihkan sungai hari Sabtu pagi. 
                            Vivi  sangat senang dan menceritakan tentang rencananya  kepada orang tuanya ketika ia sampai rumah.<br>
                            Hari yang ditunggu-tunggu Vivi pun datang. 
                            Murid-murid dan guru sudah berkumpul di sungai dekat rumah Vivi. 
                            Mereka sudah siap membersihkan sampah plastik di sungai. 
                            Setelah dua jam membersihkan sungai, akhirnya mereka selesai. Sungai itu menjadi bersih tanpa sampah.<br>
                            “Eh Vi, kita kan sudah selesai membersihkan sungai, nih. 
                            Tapi, gimana kalau ada orang-orang membuang sampah di sungai ini lagi? 
                            Tidak mungkin setiap hari kita membersihkan sampah, kan?” bisik Indy di tengah kerumunan teman-temannya.<br>
                            “Hmm, iya juga ya. Kita kan tidak tahu siapa orang yang membuang sampah plastik ini. 
                            Aku coba cari ide dulu deh,” kata Vivi.<br>
                            Keesokan harinya, Indy menelpon Vivi bahwa ada lagi beberapa sampah plastik di sungai.<br>
                            “Duh, Vi. Tadi siang aku pergi ke sungai, tapi ada lagi sampah di sana,” keluh Indy.<br>
                            “Mungkin warga yang tinggal di pinggir sungai membuang sampah plastik itu,” ucap Vivi.<br>
                            Pada hari Senin, Vivi sedang beristirahat di kantin sekolah. Saat ingin keluar kantin, 
                            ia melihat ada papan peringatan untuk tidak membuang sampah sembarangan. 
                            Ia pun mendapat ide untuk membuat papan peringatan untuk tidak membuang sampah di sungai. 
                            Vivi memberitahu Indy tentang idenya, dan Indy akan ke rumah Vivi untuk membuat papan peringatan. 
                            Sesampainya di rumah, Vivi segera mengganti baju, kemudian menyiapkan spidol. 
                            Tak lama kemudian, Indy pun datang membawa beberapa papan kayu.<br>
                            “Jadi, kita akan menuliskan peringatan dilarang membuang sampah di sungai. Terutama sampah plastik. 
                            Lalu, kita bawa papan kayunya ke sungai dan kita letakkan itu di pinggir sungai,” 
                            jelas Vivi <br>. Akhirnya, mereka pun selesai membuat papan peringatan. Mereka langsung membawa papan itu ke pinggir sungai.<br>
                            Suatu hari, Vivi dan Indy pergi ke sungai untuk mengecek apakah masih ada sampah plastik di sungai.<br>
                            “Sepertinya tidak ada yang membaca papan peringatan kita. Masih ada saja sampah plastik di sungai. 
                            Apakah papan peringatan kita kurang banyak?” tanya Vivi.<br>
                            “Sepertinya papan peringatan kita sudah cukup. 
                            Bagaimana kalau kita coba juga buat tempat sampah berbentuk ring basket?” usul Indy. <br>
                            “Aku pernah melihat di internet dan sepertinya cukup menarik.”<br>
                            “Kenapa harus ring basket?” tanya Vivi heran.<br>
                            “Supaya membuang sampah ke tempatnya jadi kegiatan yang seru. 
                            Kalau seru, orang akan tertarik untuk melakukannya.”<br>
                            “Wah, boleh juga ide kamu. Nanti kita minta bantuan Bu Guru saja, ya,” kata Vivi.<br>
                            Beberapa hari kemudian, ketua RT menanyakan pada warga apakah ada yang memasang papan peringatan di pinggir sungai.<br>
                            “Oh iya Pak RT, aku dan Indy yang memasang papan peringatan itu agar warga-warga yang tinggal di sekitar sungai tidak membuang sampah sembarangan ke sungai. 
                            Karena sampah-sampah yang dibuang sembarangan, ikan-ikan di sungai akan mati. Tapi, masih ada saja sampah yang dibuang sembarangan di sungai,” jelas Vivi.<br>
                            “Kami juga berencana membuat tempat sampah berbentuk ring basket  agar warga yang tinggal di pinggir sungai tertarik membuang sampah di tempatnya,” jelas Indy.<br>
                            “Oh, ide bagus itu. Bagaimana kalau saya dan warga membantu membuat tempat sampahnya?” Ketua RT menawarkan bantuannya.<br>
                            “Wah, tentu saja boleh. Nanti kita letakkan tempat sampahnya di dekat sungai.”<br>  
                            Mereka pun mulai membuat tempat sampah. Tak terasa tempat sampah berbentuk ring basket sudah jadi. 
                            Mereka kemudian memasang tempat sampah itu di dekat sungai.<br>
                            “Semoga para warga segera sadar tentang bahaya membuang sampah plastik di sungai dan tidak membuang sampah plastik lagi,” 
                            kata Indy dengan penuh harap.<br>
                            Setelah selesai, semua warga mencoba permainan baru itu. 
                            Satu persatu sampah dilempar ke tempat sampah berbentuk ring basket. Seru sekali. 
                            Rasanya seperti berlatih bola basket sembari membuang sampah.<br>
                            Beberapa hari kemudian, Vivi dan Indy pergi ke sungai. Mereka menemukan sampah plastik lagi di sungai itu sudah jauh berkurang. 
                            Mereka sangat puas dengan usaha mereka untuk mengingatkan warga bahwa sungai bukan tempat membuang sampah.

                            <br>
                            Di hari Minggu yang cerah, Aurora bermain ke rumah Mita. 
                            Mereka berdua  sudah menjadi sahabat sejak kelas 3 SD. Wajah Mita terlihat sangat sedih. <br>
                            “Mita, kenapa sih kamu sedih?” tanya Aurora. <br>
                            “Soalnya ayahku mau pindah ke Sulawesi. Aku juga harus ikut,” jawab Mita. <br>
                            Aurora ikut sedih karena mereka akan berpisah. 
                            Aurora ingin membuat hadiah untuk Mita sebagai kenang-kenangan, tetapi ia bingung hadiahnya apa. <br>
                            “Apa ya hadiah paling pas buat Mita?” pikir Aurora. <br>
                            Beberapa hari kemudian, ibu guru memberikan pengumuman bahwa akan ada kunjungan ke pantai. <br>
                            “Hore!” Semua anak sangat gembira mendengar hal itu. Begitu juga Aurora dan Mita.<br>
                            “Aku senang pergi ke pantai. Aku suka laut yang biru dan pasir putih,” kata Mita.<br>
                            “Aku akan membuat istana pasir,” tambah Aurora.<br>
                            Hari yang murid-murid tunggu pun tiba. Pagi itu, semua murid berkumpul di halaman sekolah. 
                            Para murid asyik mengobrol di perjalanan menuju pantai. Hingga akhirnya mereka sampai di tujuan. 
                            Mereka sangat senang. Ada yang langsung foto-foto, ada yang mengobrol di tepi pantai, dan lain-lain.<br>
                            Betapa terkejutnya kedua sahabat itu. Pantai itu sangat kotor. 
                            Sampah berserakan di mana-mana. Ada bungkus es krim, kotak minuman, plastik mentega, plastik kecap, dan masih banyak lagi. 
                            Keduanya menjadi sedih. <br>
                            “Duh, siapa ya yang membuang sampah sembarangan begini?” tanya Aurora.<br>
                            “Mungkin para pengunjung pantai yang lain,” jawab Mita. “Bisa juga sampah itu terbawa ombak dari laut.”<br>
                            “Aku mau pulang aja, deh, kalau begini,” kata Aurora lagi. “Aku malas kalau pantainya kotor begini.”<br>
                            “Eh, jangan pulang dulu, dong. Justru kita harus membersihkan pantai ini,” sergah Mita.<br>
                            “Untuk apa? Ini, kan bukan tanggung jawab kita,” kata Aurora.<br>
                            “Menjaga lingkungan hidup itu tanggung jawab semua orang,” tambah Mita. 
                            “Lagipula kalau kita biarkan begitu saja, makhluk lain akan menderita. Hewan-hewan di laut akan mati. 
                            Mereka akan memakan sampah itu.”<br>
                            “Tapi kita ke sini, kan buat bersenang-senang.”<br>
                            “Ini juga menyenangkan, kok,” bujuk Mita. “Sebentar saja.”<br>
                            Aurora sebenarnya malas, tapi akhirnya ia mau membantu. Tidak ada salahnya juga, pikirnya.
                            Akhirnya Aurora mengikuti langkah Mita. 
                            Mita sibuk memunguti beberapa sampah plastik, seperti botol minuman, kotak minuman, sedotan, plastik snack.
                            Mereka juga mengajak teman yang lain ikut membantu. Ternyata mereka mau membantu Aurora dan Mita. 
                            Bu Guru senang sekali karena Mita dan Aurora memberikan contoh yang baik.<br>
                            Tak lama kemudian mereka duduk bersama di pinggir pantai. 
                            Sekarang hamparan pasir di tepi pantai sudah jauh lebih bersih dan terlihat indah. 
                            Suasana terasa nyaman dan menyenangkan. <br>
                            “Kalau sudah bersih begini, kan enak pantainya,” puji Mita.<br>
                            “Iya. Kita bisa bermain pasir dan membuat istana pasir dengan nyaman. Kita tidak perlu takut tiba-tiba menyerok plastik,” ujar Aurora.<br>
                            “Sayang ya kamu mau pindah. Kalau tidak, kita bisa kembali bermain ke pantai ini,” tambahnya.<br>
                            “Seandainya kita bersama-sama terus ya.”<br>
                            “Eh, Mita,” kata Aurora tiba-tiba. “Kita foto bersama dulu, ya. Supaya ada kenang-kenangan hari ini.”<br>
                            “Ayo!”<br>
                            Mereka bergaya dan berfoto bersama. Setelah berfoto, Aurora melihat ke tumpukan sampah yang telah mereka kumpulkan. <br>
                            “Eh, Mita, ngomong-ngomong sampah itu bisa digunakan untuk apa saja, ya?”<br>
                            “Banyak. Misalnya untuk didaur ulang menjadi beragam barang, seperti tikar, pigura, tas, dan lain-lain,” kata Mita.<br>
                            “Oh, begitu,” Aurora mengangguk-angguk. Mendadak ia terpikir sebuah ide.<br>
                            Setelah satu bulan acara piknik ke pantai, Mita pun pindah. 
                            Saat mereka berpisah, Aurora memberikan hadiah perpisahan. 
                            Sebelum Mita pergi, mereka berpelukan sangat erat. Berat rasanya berpisah dengan sahabat.<br>
                            Di pesawat, Mita membuka hadiah itu. Mita terkejut. 
                            Ternyata Aurora membuat pigura dengan hiasan di pinggir dari kemasan sampah plastik yang mereka kumpulkan dulu. 
                            Di dalamnya ada foto mereka bersama di pantai dengan latar belakang sampah-sampah plastik yang sudah mereka kumpulkan.<br>
                            Di foto tersebut terdapat tulisan :
                            <span style="font-family: cursive; font-size: small;">Untuk sahabatku yang mencintai pantai. Semoga kenangan bersama di pantai itu selalu bersamamu.</span> <br>
                            Mita meneteskan air mata karena terharu. Itu adalah hadiah yang sempurna untuk Mita.
