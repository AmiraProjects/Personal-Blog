                  This project will be the simplest one. I made this just to
                  relax and trying to memorize things I had learn from my coding
                  course. It's about catching healthy foods that was falling and
                  let the unhealthy ones fall. Thats why the title is Food Fall.
                  Oh ya, one more, if we catch a water bottle, it will add the
                  health points. It was pretty easy to make since it just took 3
                  days for me to finish and only consist of few codes & layouts.
                  I just have to find or draw many foods or drinks to be the
                  sprites. This game can be played both on computer and phone
                  but it's easier to play on phone rather than on a computer.

              <h3>Projects -- The Glorious of Math</h3>
              <p>
                Hi guys! Finally! I can make a project with my friends, but this
                is just a prototype. We collaborate for about 2 weeks. For me,
                the coding step took quiet a long time to finish because I have
                to manage my time with school tasks and prepare for school
                exams. Since I'm not really good at drawing, I told my friend
                Gadiza to draw the characters. Nara create the questions by
                herself and Aisha search for the background on google with no
                copyright. Oh ya, this game can only be played on a computer or
                PC. If you're interested to see it, here's the link: <br />

              <h3>Projects -- Space Exploration</h3>
              <p>
                The first game I made with construct. I created this as my first
                coding course task. It's filled with basic codes and the
                animations was still stiff. Also, mostly the sprites are from
                google and I only draw some details like boxes, trophies and the
                sky on Inkscape or the construct itself. This game is about an
                adventurer that crashed land on a dangerous planet, and she had
                to go back to her ship and met her friend. After she get into
                the ship, she will explore 3 other planets. It's actually
                optional for you to play. The goal is to open the box and get
                the trophy for those 3 planets. It was pretty hard to make. It
                took about 2-3 week to finish even though I continue making this
                during free time. It can only be played on a laptop or computer.

              <h3>Project -- Feeding Fish</h3>
              <p>
                The "Feeding Fish" game is about a fish that was searching for
                its food in the ocean. But, there are lots of plastics inside
                the oceans, so it has to avoid them while searching for food.
                There was also jelly fish & octopus to avoid. This game was made
                in just 1 week since its very simple game & easy to make. To
                play this game, you will have to select the fish's skin first.
                There were 10 skin you can choose. Then, you can play the game
                by pressing the arrow button to move. This game type is endless,
                which means there is no end as long as the fish had a life. When
                the game was over, you can choose between replay (play the game
                again, same skin, saves your high score) or restart (play the
                game again, choose new skin, but didn't save your high score).
                Each small fish had different amount of score when you eat them.
                The orange fish gives you 1 life & scores although they were
                fast and hard to catch. <br />

              <h3>
                My Thoughts -> The Difficulties of Finding Programmer in
                Indonesia, Is It True?
              </h3>
              <p>
                After I read some news about The Difficulties of Finding
                Programmer in Indonesia, I was sad that many Indonesian
                companies had to hire programmers from other countries like
                India, Vietnam or Australia. This is the reason why I wanted to
                be a programmer other than because I like it. Even Gojek had to
                hire people from India to work for them and had built an office
                on Bengaluru, India. So that’s why Indonesia needed programmers
                and engineers to increase the growth of economy. The quality of
                education on IT ranks 8 in Southeast Asia. I think the
                government needs to develop the logic of Indonesian people more
                and since young age. For example, coding should be taught
                earlier, and kids need to have chance to code, either making
                simple, useful website or application like in Singapore. We also
                should develop education in Indonesia especially regarding the
                importance of technology for the future and improving the
                education quality on IT. Those are some of my opinions about The
                Difficulties of Finding Programmer in Indonesia.

              <h3>My Thoughts -> Ujian Terberat</h3>
              <p>
                Holaa, jangan bosen ya kalo aku post-post lagi. Mumpung masih
                ada 2 hari lagi nih liburnya.
                <br />
                Finally! Semua ujian udah aku laluin! Except Mock ya karena baru
                dikerjakan bulan Mei. Ujian kali ini berat banget : 3 minggu
                berturut-turut dari TO kecamatan, final exam, ujian sekolah.
                Belum lagi aku ikut Cambridge Checkpoint yang berarti aku harus
                masuk sekolah 2 hari sebelum libur (Ada juga sih beberapa
                temenku yang ikut checkpoint juga). Dan aku ngerjain semua ujian
                itu pas puasa. Untung aja kita go home nya lebih cepet - yang
                biasanya jam setengah 3, jadi jam 11 udah pulang. Jadi aku bisa
                langsung istirahat pas sampe rumah. After semua ujian itu
                selesai, ada 2-week holiday yang menunggu. Pokoknya aku happy
                banget setelah hari terakhir Cambridge checkpoint selesai. Aku
                bisa bebas ngapain aja pas libur! Aku bisa jalan-jalan ke mall,
                main game, nonton, dan posting blog ini juga! Aku juga main sih
                sama sepupuku. Tapi yang 1 masih bocil & yang 1 lagi baru kelas
                4. Mungkin karena kelamaan libur, aku jadi bosen juga, bingung
                mau ngapain lagi 😅. Anddd, ternyata 1.5 bulan lagi aku
                graduation & 18 Juli aku udah SMP, yeayy. Gak kerasa ya, cepet
                banget.

              <h3>My Thoughts -> Baju Seragam</h3>
              <p>
                Finallyyyy! seragam sekolahku akhirnya udah bisa diambilll. Baju
                polo, kain batik sama kain buat bawahan udah ada. Tinggal jahit
                kain batik sama celana nya. Rencanyanya seragam batikku mau
                kayak gini :
                <br />
                Tapi aku masih milih-milih model yang cocok sama aku. Yang
                jelas, aku pakai model kerah Shanghai sama celana panjang. Kerah
                Shanghai yang aku pakai nanti seperti ini:
                <br />
                Kerah Shanghai adalah model pakaian yang memiliki bagian kerah
                pendek dan pas di leher dengan bagian depan yang membentuk huruf
                V. Dinamakan seperti itu karena model kerah ini diadaptasi dari
                pakaian tradisional wanita Tionghoa yang disebut dengan
                cheongsam. Aku pakai kerah Shanghai karena, menurutku lebih
                nyaman. Aku juga tidak perlu mengaitkan kancing yang paling
                atas. Dan yang paling penting adalah kerah Shanghai memenuhi
                aturan dress code sekolah.

              <h3>
                My Thoughts -> "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham
              </h3>
              <p>
                Hi friends, I'm finally back since I'm off a few months ago! In
                the past weeks, I've been reading a book about stock market A
                little bit krn isinya 'membagongkan'. I dont know membagongkan
                in english, wkwkwk. To be specific, the history of stock market
                since the establishment of Wall Street. Turns out it's pretty
                complicated😅. Also, I'm sorry if you all didn't understand
                since this book explained the history not in order and it's hard
                for me to make it in order (maybe because it's also my
                first-time reading about investment) 🙏. Dan ini juga sebenernya
                challenge from my dad & mom utk ngisi liburan term 1. <br />

              <h3>Short Story (Akankah Sungai Kembali Jernih?)</h3>
              <p>
                I made this story for a writing competition (I forgot the name)
                about taking care of the Environment. <br />
                This story is basically about an elementary school student (prob
                6th grade) named Vivi who likes to go fishing with her friend.
                But, the river near her house where she used to go fishing is
                full of trash that makes fishing way harder than before. So, she
                and her friends cleaned up the trash in the river. However, it
                just didn't work well as there were trashes again in the river.
                So, what did she do next? <br />

              <h3>Short Story (Hadiah yang Sempurna)</h3>
              <p>
                I wrote this story when I was in elementary school for a writing
                competition from Unilever (again, it's about environmental
                care). This story revolves around 2 friends who must parted ways
                due to family reasons. They wanted to create a memorable moment
                and give gifts that they will always remember. One day, their
                class held a field trip to a beach. The 2 friends were super
                happy. As soon as they arrived at the beach, they're surprised
                by how the beach condition. <br />
