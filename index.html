                                This project will be the simplest one. 
                                I made this just to relax and trying to memorize things I had learn from my coding course. 
                                It's about catching healthy foods that was falling and let the unhealthy ones fall. 
                                Thats why the title is Food Fall. 
                                Oh ya, one more, if we catch a water bottle, it will add the health points. 
                                It was pretty easy to make since it just took 3 days for me to finish and only consist of few codes & layouts. 
                                I just have to find or draw many foods or drinks to be the sprites.

                                This game can be played both on computer and phone but it's easier to play on phone rather than on a computer. <br>

                        <h3>Projects -- The Glorious of Math</h3>
                        <p>Hi guys!
                        Finally! I can make a project with my friends, but this is just a prototype. 
                        We collaborate for about 2 weeks. 
                        For me, the coding step took quiet a long time to finish because I have to manage my time with school tasks and prepare for school exams. 
                        Since I'm not really good at drawing, I told my friend Gadiza to draw the characters. 
                        Nara create the questions by herself and Aisha search for the background on google with no copyright.
                        If you're interested to see it, here's the link: <br>
                        <input type="submit" value="The Glorious of Math" class="submit"><br>
                        Oh ya, this game can only be played on a computer or PC.
